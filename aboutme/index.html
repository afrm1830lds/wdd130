   <p> Hi everyone! I'm very honored to be part of this class. My Name is Felipe, I live in Quito, Ecuador and  I'm a convert to the Church. Very soon, I will receive my endowment in the Guayaquil Temple! This wonderful gospel has brought so much into my life. For me, being part of this educational system is such a blessing. I will never be thankful enough to our Heavenly Father and our Savior for this chance to improve my life both spiritually and academically.</p>
   <p >I'm always open to learning from everyone around me. My major is Applied technology, and my main interests are wearable technologies and related software development. I love playing drums and photography. Here in Ecuador, landscapes and nature are unbelievable. </p>
