            <h4>Believers of Change:</h4>
            <p>On this page, we care about you. So, we expect only one thing in return, for you to progress.  If you have felt alone and overwhelmed, or maybe find yourself thinking, 
                "I'm not capable of anything anymore", arise today. We are looking for people with any illness to get better and give a first step in the right direction. There are many ways to participate. 
                For example, try to share your story briefly in our external daily blog or maybe, you could pick up others' experiences in our highlights section. There are always meaningful things to 
                catch up with what the site does. Use the Volunteers link to learn more about public resources, professional testimonies, or local health professionalâ€™s information. If there's something urgent 
                you have to talk to someone, please press the red button at the bottom of this page, follow the instructions, and then check out your email. Any information gathered by this website is confidential 
                and will never be revealed to anyone else. In every case, the person submitting materials has to approve and consent to the information through a disclaimer.  This is a support page to connect people 
                with similar health issues with not well-known resources, and even other people willing to help.</p>
