                <h4>Why people could be interested in this website?</h4>
                <p>This website has a clear purpose, connecting people so they can have the chance to be more empathic
                    and helpful to one another.
                    Looking at the big picture, and only with a limited local scope, our initial data suggest that more
                    than 60 % of the people that participated
                    in our first polls have experienced an unusual increase in health problems like depression, anxiety,
                    or eating disorders after the pandemic arrived.</p>

                        professionals could share general knowledge about specific health issues, instructions about
                        public health recourses, and some of their contact information.</p>
