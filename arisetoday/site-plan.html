      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this personal website will be to create a free and secure bridge between people with specific health struggles and part of the help they need to overcome their situation.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience has two groups: People having weight or self-esteem problems and physical and emotional local health professionals. Each group will have a child page of its own, and the home page will contain general information about both groups that could lead users, in general, to think about their daily habits by reflecting on others' highlighted stories. The audience will be people older than 16 and from diverse backgrounds and beliefs.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Why people could be interested in this website (arise today)? <br> 
        <br>
        The Reasons <br>
        This website has a clear purpose, connecting people so they can have the chance to be more empathic and helpful to one another. 
        Looking at the big picture, and only with a limited local scope, our initial data suggest that more than 60 % of the people that participated 
        in our first polls have experienced an unusual increase in health problems like depression, anxiety, or eating disorders after the pandemic arrived. <br>
        <br>
        Our proposal <br>
        Share knowledge and overcome struggles. This web site role is to allow visitors to connect. There are two main sections divided into child pages.  
        Page one is for people looking for help anonymously or someone trying to share their uplifting stories with others. And the second page is where health 
        professionals could share general knowledge about specific health issues, instructions about public health recourses, and some of their contact information. <br>
        <br>
        What can you expect? <br>
        The only thing necessary is to show interest and get involved by following all the protocols, which are very user-friendly. This website articulates, edits,  
        and publishes images, text, and hyperlinks combined through the hard work of its moderators. We receive others' information and convert it into blog posts that 
        get uploaded after the person's approval. Also, by observing that all the established community guidelines are fulfilled and by receiving the person's digitally 
        signed disclaimer before posting. 

      </p>
